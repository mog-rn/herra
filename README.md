# Herra Amana: Technology as a Shield, Empowerment as a Mission

**Herra Amana**—translating to "Love and Light" in the Luo language—is a  mobile application dedicated to enhancing the safety and well-being of women in Kenya and the world . In response to the escalating violence against women, Herra Amana leverages advanced technology to provide discreet, reliable, and empowering safety solutions. By integrating robust backend systems with intuitive user interfaces, Herra Amana offers women the tools they need to navigate their environments with confidence and peace of mind.


## The Crisis

In Kenya, violence against women has escalated from isolated incidents to a pervasive national emergency. Daily, women face threats ranging from domestic abuse to femicide, often feeling trapped by circumstances and limited options for help. Traditional support systems, while valuable, frequently fail to provide immediate assistance when women need it most.

The most insidious aspect of this crisis is its silence. Many women are unable to seek help openly due to:

- **Constant Surveillance by Abusive Partners:** Abusers often monitor their victims' communications and movements, making it difficult for women to seek help without detection.
- **Fear of Escalating Violence if Discovered:** Women fear that seeking help will provoke further violence from their abusers.
- **Limited Access to Support Networks:** Many women lack access to reliable support networks that can provide timely assistance.
- **Social Stigma and Cultural Barriers:** Societal norms and cultural expectations often discourage women from speaking out against abuse.

## Key Features

### Safety Module

**Herra Amana** prioritizes the safety of its users through a multifaceted safety module that includes:

- **Emergency Contacts:** Users can designate multiple emergency contacts, ensuring that help is always just a tap away. These contacts are categorized (e.g., Emergency, Wellness Coach, Friend) to streamline communication during critical moments.

- **Safe Zones:** The app allows users to set up predefined safe zones such as home, workplace, or any trusted location. Utilizing GeoDjango's spatial capabilities, these zones are visually represented on a map, and the app continuously monitors the user's presence within these areas.

- **Journey Tracking:** For users who are on the move, the journey tracking feature monitors their path from start to destination. If deviations from the expected route are detected, the app triggers alerts to notify emergency contacts.

- **Emergency Alerts:** In case of an emergency, users can trigger alerts that send their current location and status to their emergency contacts. These alerts are discreetly designed as wellness timers to ensure user safety without causing unnecessary panic.

### Cycle Tracking

Understanding and monitoring one's menstrual cycle is pivotal for overall health. **Herra Amana** offers an intuitive cycle tracking module that includes:
